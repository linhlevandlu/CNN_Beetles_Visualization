# CNN_Beetles_Visualization (CBV)

This is a visualization program that visualizes the test process in deep learning method.
The program receives a test image, a trained model and outputs the prediction of the test image.
Specifically, CBV inputs a beetle's anatomical image and corresponding trained model, then it will predict the landmarks on this anatomical image.
